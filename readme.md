# Taylor Cina WGU Portfolio

This is my portfolio of selected work done during my time at Western Governors University. The repo contains two folders with projects for my Bachelor of Science, Software Engineering (BSSWE) and Master of Science, Data Analytics (MSDA) degrees. This serves as both my demonstration of competency to prospective employers as well as a resource for future WGU students.

The naming discrepancy is the result of getting a legal name change during my schooling.
